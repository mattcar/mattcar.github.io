<p>Hello there! This is just an introductory post as I get used to working with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Over the next several weeks, I'll be posting blogs that cover a variety of topics (mostly at the introductory level):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Rails</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</li>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
  <li>Maybe some non-tech related topics :)</li>
</ul>
